Git Commit and Push Workflow
1. Make changes to the project
2. Open GitKraken(Client)
3. Stage files with changes
4. Add a commit message(no exceptions.  You can't commit documents without it)
5. Commit files to Client
6. Push files from computer to cloud.  Do this often.  It is very important
7. If unsure, check on GitHub to see if the changes have appeared.
