    ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</p>
    <p>Hi.  My name is Natalie Marotzek, and I am the one who made this website.</p>  
    <p>I made this game as a project for learning HTML and game coding.
    Please give it a try and let me know what you think.  I can take constructive criticism, but please don't be rude about it.  This is my first full coding adventure, after all.</p>
    <p>The aim of the game is that you are a geologist exploring a recently discovered cave.  You've been tasked to find what this cave holds and bring samples back with you.</p>
